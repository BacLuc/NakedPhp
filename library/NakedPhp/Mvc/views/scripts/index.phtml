<h1>Welcome to NakedPhp!</h1>
<p>This is the index of the NakedPhp controller, which provides all the features of this framework and implements (with the help of the NakedPhp library) the Naked Objects pattern.</p>
<p>What does it mean? That form, list and other piece of the user interface is automatically generated basing of annotations of your Domain Model. You want a blog? No need to write forms, only the User and Post classes.</p>
<p>You want the interface to look good? Put the pieces in the layout of your choice with Css rules.</p>
<p>This is not scaffolding: the objects in the application Domain Model have real behavior and are not simply database rows, but full features service classes and entity ones. If you're not satisfied, you can always use this interface only for prototyping, though.</p>
